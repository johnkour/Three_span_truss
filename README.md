# Three_span_truss
Part of the project: Machine learning projects. This reposatory is dedicated to the analysis of a three span truss. The truss contains 11 elements. The standard section of every element is SHS. After the analysis a NN is fitted to the data to predict whether the truss fails or not.
The file **solver.py** can be used to solve a truss with a specific geometry.
